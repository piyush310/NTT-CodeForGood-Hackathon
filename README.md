## Our Approach
Disaster response is the second phase of the disaster Management cycle. It consists of a number of elements, for example, warning, evacuation, search and rescue, providing immediate assistance, assessing damage, continuing assistance and the immediate restoration.
So among all, we have worked upon warning system for floods. In this, we have provided a user interface to the common public to check the level of water flow in rivers in future and have a provided a mechanism of notification if there is any possibility of flood due to any river in nearby future(12 months). Along with that users can also see the historical trends of rivers flow and can visualize the rainfall patterns also in their Sub-Division(Area).
So with that much information beforehand and knowing the chances of the flood in any region we can prepare ourselves and alert the local public so that loss would be minimum.
